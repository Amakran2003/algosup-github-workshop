# ALGOSUP Github Workshop

_Github workshop using git bash &amp; other tools..._

## Step 1

* Log on Github
* Fork this repository

## Step 2

* Install Git bash (if not already installed)
  * Download URL: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  * Answer all the questions during the installation process. Regarding the `line-ending` settings, select `Checkout as-is, commit as-is`

## Step 3

* Download the Git cheat-sheet from here: [git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf](docs/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
* Git clone your fork in your local folder
  * For this you will have to provide a login and password
  * the login is your github login (email or username)
  * the password is usually a token you created for a project/machine/OS/IP location (the token is not your github password)
* You should now have a local repository of this workshop repository

## Step 4

_let's the fun begin._ For this workshop we will use the Lua version of the HARFANG 3D engine to practice the usage of Git bash/Git VS Code.

* Download the Lua release of HARFANG 3D for Windows64 from here: [HG 3.2.7 Releases](https://github.com/harfang3d/harfang3d/releases)
* Deploy the binaries of Lua into a new directory of your local repository. A `bin/` directory should be fine.
* Download the HARFANG tutorials from [here](https://github.com/harfang3d/tutorials-hg2) (as a zip file)
* Find the tutorial named `game_mouse_flight.lua`
* Git add the new file
* Git commit
* Git push


* Copy the `resources` directory from the tutorials into your local repository
